## Programs:
1. MATLAB program to plot the frequency response of the given 2D sequence of A, B and C
* MATLAB program for following resolutions:
  * spatial resolution
  * intensity resolution
* MATLAB function for plotting histogram and histogram equalization
* MATLAB program for basic gray level transformations:
  * negative
  * log transformation
  * inverse log transformation
  * power law transformation with gamma < 1 and gamma > 1
* MATLAB program for gray level slicing with background and without background
* MATLAB program for bit plane slicing also extract, all 8-bit plane
* MATLAB program for smoothing filter:
  * add Gausian noise and apply smoothing filter using 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 mask
* MATLAB program which is remedy of spatial filter and compare the results with above program
* MATLAB code for median filtering. Take image, corrupt with salt and pepper noise and apply 3x3, 5x5 and 7x7 mask for median filter
* MATLAB program which emphasize for phase data. Consider any two image and take FFT of the images. Take magnitude from first image with phase from second image and vice versa to reconstruct the mixing image and observe.
* Prove that convolution in spacial domain is equal to multiplication in frequency domain. Prove this by a MATLAB program.
